# web-scrapper-caps

# Project description
Price comparison websites are useful tools that compare the price of the same product 
at several retailers and can take off the pressure from finding the best deals for a 
product.
#The products chosen for this project are caps and hats; therefore, the website name
is Caps and Hats Compare, a price comparison website that helps users find the best 
prices for the desired product. The products chosen for this project are caps. The 
website contains two pages: the main page with the search option and the comparison 
page. The first page of the website contains a search bar and products displayed 
below once the customer search for them. When the user clicks on the desired 
product, the second page is landed with the product and different prices.
# Web scraping
To extract data from different websites, developers use different scrapping methods. 
The tool chosen to scrape different websites for this project is Selenium. Selenium is 
a powerful tool that can be used to scrape data from complicated web pages that 
require authentication, making it one of the most well-liked tools for web scraping. It 
can also mimic user activities like selecting an option, clicking a button, or filling out a 
form. 
The websites scrapped for this project are:

• https://www.nike.com/
• "https://www.ftshp.co.uk/
